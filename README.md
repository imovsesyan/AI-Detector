# AI-Detector
The Armenian AI Text Detector is a machine learning system designed to automatically identify whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI model. It focuses specifically on Armenian-language content, where existing AI detectors perform poorly due to limited datasets and linguistic complexity.
🧠 Armenian AI Text Detector

Reliable AI-generated text detection for the Armenian language

The Armenian AI Text Detector is a machine learning system designed to determine whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI model.
Unlike most existing detectors, this project focuses specifically on Armenian-language content, where commercial solutions perform poorly due to limited datasets and linguistic complexity.

This project was initiated to support Armenian governmental institutions, media organizations, and educational sectors in improving content authenticity and combating misinformation.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Detects AI-generated text in Armenian

✅ Transformer-based classifier (RoBERTa / Gemma / LLaMA fine-tuned)

✅ Custom Armenian dataset (human + AI)

✅ Probability score output (AI vs Human)

✅ Script and API usage

✅ Deployment-ready inference pipeline
