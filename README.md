Armenian AI Text Detector

The Armenian AI Text Detector is a machine learning system designed to determine whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI model. This project focuses specifically on Armenian-language content, where existing commercial AI detectors perform poorly due to limited datasets and linguistic characteristics of the Armenian language.

The project was developed to support Armenian governmental institutions, media organizations, and educational sectors in improving content authenticity and combating misinformation.

Key Features

• Detects AI-generated text in Armenian
• Transformer-based classifier (RoBERTa / Gemma / LLaMA fine-tuned)
• Custom Armenian dataset (human and AI texts)
• Probability score output (AI vs Human)
• Script and API usage
• Deployment-ready inference pipeline

cd ai-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt

Quick Usage

Command line example:

python src/inference.py --text "Ձեր տեքստը այստեղ"

Output example:

Prediction: AI-generated
Confidence: 0.82

Python example:

from src.inference import detect_text
text = "Ողջույն, ինչպես ես?"
result = detect_text(text)
print(result)

API Usage (Optional)

Run the API server:

uvicorn src.api:app --reload

Example request:

POST /predict
{
"text": "Տեքստի օրինակ"
}

Example response:

{
"label": "human",
"score": 0.73
}

Dataset

The dataset includes:

Human-written Armenian texts:

official documents

news articles

essays and academic writing

AI-generated texts from:

ChatGPT

Claude

Gemini

other large language models

All samples were cleaned, normalized, labeled, and balanced for training.

Model Training

Data preprocessing and tokenization

Fine-tuning a transformer model

Evaluation and benchmarking

Exporting the best-performing model

To train the model:

python src/train.py

Performance

Accuracy: XX%
F1 Score: XX%
Precision: XX%
Recall: XX%

The model performs significantly better than generic English AI detectors on Armenian text.

Purpose and Impact

This project aims to support governmental sectors in verifying document authenticity, assist media organizations in identifying AI-generated content, contribute to Armenian NLP research, and build the first reliable Armenian AI detector.

Technologies Used

Python 3
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Scikit-learn
FastAPI (optional)
NumPy
pandas
Tokenizers

Roadmap

• Improve dataset size and diversity
• Add support for dialects and informal Armenian
• Evaluate on education-sector texts
• Web interface / dashboard
• Public model release on Hugging Face
