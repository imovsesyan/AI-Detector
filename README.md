# AI-Detector
The Armenian AI Text Detector is a machine learning system designed to automatically identify whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI model. It focuses specifically on Armenian-language content, where existing AI detectors perform poorly due to limited datasets and linguistic complexity.
